<h1>About us</h1>

<p style="line-height: 1cm; font-size:150%; text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Smart Grocery is a website to help people to get information of grocery 
items or cooking ingredients, especially the times that are rare
or hard to recognize. The aim of this webpage also is to make shopping easier for the people that don't usually go to the supermarket. 
This can be very useful for city folks who are very busy with their works. Sometimes people who are already familiar with groceries also 
can be confusing and mistaken. So, on this web page, all grocery items will be inserted with pictures and detailed facts, so users can 
recognize the item easily. Every item will be included with nutritional content for the users to manage their nutrition intake.</p>
